							<h2 style="color:LightSeaGreen";>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p style="color:rgba(0,0,0,0.8)";>I am Tanaya Vijay Ramane. I was born and brought up in Pune. Since childhood, I had a strong interest in understanding how things operate and finding innovative ways to make them better. It was this excitement of mine that led me to choose engineering as my path, and I wanted to pursue it at the best college out there, which is why I joined JEE coaching and then got into IIT Kharagpur. This entire process taught me the importance of perseverance and to keep going without getting distracted in the crowd. 
I wanted to explore the world of consulting and technology, so I joined 180 Degrees Consulting (180DC) and KRSSG. I started enjoying my stint at 180DC more. At that time, the organization was just getting started, and my batchmates and I worked hard to establish the client acquisition team and define its objectives. 
With all these efforts I managed to onboard 180DC's first international project, which happened to be for a UK-based NGO recently recognized by Rishi Sunak (The Washing Machine Project). This experience not only introduced me to the field of consulting but also helped me discover my strong interest in it. The real satisfaction came when we successfully delivered all the project requirements, and the client was pleased with our work, leaving me genuinely happy. I onboarded the first international project of 180DC (a UK-based NGO that was recognized by Rishi Sunak recently). This gave me an idea of consulting and also made me realize my inclination towards it. Upon delivering all the project requirements and receiving approval from the satisfied client, I felt immensely accomplished. This experience led me to realize that I am results-driven. I feel satisfied about my work when it creates value for the end user.
After this I wanted to challenge my time management skills and ability to work effectively under pressure, for which I took up the responsibility of student placement coordinator. We secured a historic 1000+ placement offers landmark within 2 days (fastest across all IITs). I independently managed to place 80% of RGSoIPL batch.
To put my skills to the test in a corporate environment, gaining ownership and experiencing the consulting work culture, I chose to undertake a product management internship at LimeChat and a summer associate role at Boston Consulting Group. 
Over a span of 6 months, I contributed to 5 projects and lead the CTWA project, a critical project of the Limechat's meta partnership. Meta business head India commended the work and the speed to output in the CTWA project. Nikhil and Aniket, the founders of Limechat applauded me for my ownership, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail. 
As a summer associate at BCG, I worked in the industrial goods sector. It helped me improve my storylining, pitching, and structuring abilities and also gave me a flavour of what management consulting is about. 
My entire journey has shaped me into a confident individual who believes that every problem can be solved with proper planning and execution. In addition to tackling challenging problems, in my leisure time, I love to play badminton, swim, cook, and engage in crafts. I am a trained Kathak dancer, classical singer, and a harmonium player.
All in all I have several hobbies to keep myself engaged and several dreams to keep myself going.
