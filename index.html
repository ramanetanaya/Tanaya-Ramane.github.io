						<p style="color:rgba(0,0,0,0.8)";>I am Tanaya Ramane, a third year undergraduate from the department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, IIT Kharagpur
enrolled in the course of Quality Engineering Design and Manufacturing (Industrial Electronics
vertical). I define myself as an innovative, creative, helpful, friendly, and a leader. Since 
childhood I have been curious about how things work and what more improvisations could be done on it, 
for this I joined KRSSG(curiosity about how bots work and making one whole by myself was a very 
fascinating thought). Public speaking as an hobby has been inculcated in me due to various elocution 
competitions I participated in school and college, the client interactions I had being a part of the 
client acquisition team in 180 Degrees Consulting,IIT Kharagpur, other than that watching TED Talks is 
also one of the reasons. My hobbies also include sports such as swimming and badminton. I am a trained 
Kathak dancer and I love freestyle as well. Music fascinated me a lot so I learned classical singing and 
have completed three levels of the same and one of Harmonium.
